```{admonition} NUS IT
:class: tip
NUS IT provides support for IT related issues. They also provide services such as HPC and server hosting. You can submit a ticket on nTouch if you have any issues related to IT.
- [NUS VPN](https://nusit.nus.edu.sg/services/wifi_internet/nvpn/) has to be installed to access intranet and NUS HPC when you are not on campus. 
- [NUS IT webpage](https://nusit.nus.edu.sg/)
- [IT Care](https://nusit.nus.edu.sg/itcare/) and [nTouch](https://ntouch.nus.edu.sg/)
- [NUS HPC](https://nusit.nus.edu.sg/hpc/)
```
## Security
### Back up your data regularly
You must have a backup of your most important data on a cloud drive (OneDrive) or other reliable storage media. The best practice is following the 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies (including the original data), 2 different media, and 1 off-site backup copy.

### Good practice for password 
In general, for password you should use mixture of capital/small letters, numbers and symbols. Be careful about those ambiguous characters: l (ell), 1 (one), I (capital i), O (capital o), and 0 (zero). 

- Use a password manager, set a master password by yourself. See good examples below.
- For each app/website, use password manager to generate different user names and passwords.
- Setup the two(multi)-factor-authentication (2FA) for all of your account as possible.
- Use passwordless login (passkeys, biometrics, and etc.) as possible. See passkeys below.

```{admonition} Recovery Code
:class: info
You should put the recovery code of the password manager to somewhere you can easily find.
```

```{admonition} Examples of password manager
:class: info, dropdown
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), an open source password manager, and it supports all main stream OS. You can also use it in web browser. You can self-host this service.
- [Apple Passwords](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/passwords/id6473799789), app only available on Apple devices, but you can install it as extension on your web browser.
- [Microsoft Authenticator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/about-microsoft-authenticator-9783c865-0308-42fb-a519-8cf666fe0acc), it supports most main stream OS and mobile device except Linux. For desktop OS, you can install it as extension on your web browser.
- [Google Passwords](https://passwords.google.com/) The free password manager by Google.
- [1Password](https://1password.com/), a cross-platform password management tool. However you have to pay for subscription.

```

```{admonition} Passkeys
:class: tip, dropdown
You can use [Passkeys](https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys) to login passwordless to reduce the risk of password leaking from incidence such as data breaching. This function is available in most password managers, but it needs support from the remote machine as well. Currently, most big service providers supports Passkeys: Github, Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.
```

## Searching & managing literature
You should use [Find Full Text: Proxy Bookmarklet](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/findfulltext/proxybookmark) for accessing literature. For reference management, we use Zotero and you can find the guide for Zotero by [NUS Library](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/referencemanagement/zotero).

## Code repository

We use [GitHub](https://www.github.com) for data version control and storage. **Please register a GitHub account if you don't have one.**

## Learning

In this course, we will do programming using Python. You can use [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) or [Claude](https://claude.ai/) to learn and assist your programming (**not for writing your report!**). As a student, you can get [free student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) which includes Copilot if you're using VS Code. 

- Linux: If you don't know much about Linux environment, please complete [Introduction to the Unix Command Line](https://cambiotraining.github.io/unix-shell/) from Cambridge University.

- Python: You can find lots of tutorials online, for example: [MIT 6.189](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2008/pages/lecture-notes/).

```{admonition} Don't go too crazy!
:class: tip
You shouldn't go too deep in this part. You can always go back check and search. The best way to learn is through project.
```
