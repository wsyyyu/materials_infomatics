My name is Zeyu Deng, and I am an Assistant Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS). My research interests include computational materials science, multiscale modeling, and high-performance computing. Currently, my work focuses on using advanced computational techniques to uncover the design principles of materials for renewable energy applications. Outside of my scientific work, I enjoy traveling and photography. I will guide you through this course, and I hope you will learn some useful skills that will benefit you!
