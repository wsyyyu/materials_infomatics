# Computer and Computation
We will start from the basics of computer. Computer is everywhere in the digital era: calculator, smartphone, smart watch, workstation, laptop, supercomputer, cloud, inside electrical vehicles, trains, airplane etc. However the widespread of computer is only from mid-20th century. An understanding of computers is crucial to appreciate the opportunities and limitations in their application to science.

## Analogue and Digital Computer
Prior the era of modern digital computer, there are analogue computers, which utilize continuous  physical quantities such as electrical, mechanical, or fluid/hydraulic to model the problem being solved. The oldest known analogue computer is the 2000-year-old ancient Greek hand-powered orrery called Antikythera Mechanism. The machine is used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses decades. Some famous people in the early days of computer science are:

- Charles Babbage, "Father of Computing"
- Ada Lovelace, "the first programmer"
- Alan Turing, "father of theoretical computer science"

The most limitation of analogue computer is noise, which limits its accuracy. It is also vulnerable to the environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. In addition, it is expensive to maintain the analogue circuits and mechanical devices. For example, these computers need regular recalibration and maintenance. Therefore, in the 1950s to 1970s, digital computers based on first vacuum tubes, transistors, integrated circuits and then micro-processors became more economical and precise, which led digital computers to largely replace analog computers. Nowadays, you can have a complete computers on a microchip (or chip) with the size of a coin, which is also called system on a chip (SoC).

Even so, some research in analog computation is still being done. For example, quantum computer, which can perform calculations in parallel thanks to the laws of quantum mechanics and entanglement between qubits, meaning the fates of different qubits can instantly change each other. One of the example is the quantum computer developed by D-Wave based on quantum annealing. However, there is intense debate, and huge interest, in its performance.

Digital computers, on the other hand, have the advantages of high precision, flexibility and programmability, ease of data storage, simple for upgrade. The first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer is the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) developed in 1945. Most of the devices mentioned at the beginning are digital computers, and in this course, our computation will be conducted on digital computers.

## Computer Architecture
Computer architecture is the science and art of designing and integrating the fundamental components of a computer system. It defines the functional behavior of a system, its organization, and its implementation. Here's an overview of its key aspects:

| Component | Description | Function |
|---|---|---|
| **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** | The language software uses to communicate with hardware. | Defines instructions the processor understands, impacting performance and compatibility. |
| **Processor (CPU)** | The "brain" of the computer. | Executes instructions from the ISA. Contains Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit, and Registers. |
| **Memory** |  Stores data and instructions. | **Primary Memory (RAM):** Fast but volatile storage for active data.  **Secondary Memory (Hard Drive, SSD):** Permanent storage even when powered off. |
| **Input/Output (I/O) Devices** | Allow interaction with the outside world. | Keyboard, mouse, screen, network adapters, etc., controlled by the CPU and interact with memory. |
| **Buses** | Pathways for data and instructions to travel between components. | Internal buses connect CPU to memory; external buses connect peripherals. |
| **Hierarchy** |  Organizes components in a structured manner. | Often includes levels of cache near the CPU to speed up access to frequently used data.|
| **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)** | Specialized processor for handling graphics and visual computations.  | Designed for parallel processing, excels at tasks like rendering images, video editing, and machine learning. |
